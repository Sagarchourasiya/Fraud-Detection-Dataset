Financial Fraud Detection Model with DashBoard

Project Overview:
The Financial Fraud Detection Model utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analytics to identify suspicious transactions,
detect fradulent activities, and provide real time insights via an interactive dashboard. This system is essential for banks,
fintech companies, and financial institutions to mitigate risks and prevent financial fraud.

Key Features:
1) Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
 - Collect transactional data from banking systems, payment gateways, and financial records.
 - Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
 - Handle missing values and apply data normalization techniques.
 - Feature engineering to extract behavioral patterns and anomalies.
2) Fraud detection Algorithms
Supervised Learning Models:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decicion Trees and random Forest
 - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
3) Unsupervised Learning Models
 - Isolation Forest
 - One-Class SVM
 - Autoencoders (Deep Learning-based anomaly detection)
4) Graph-Based analysis
 - Detecting fraudulent networks and relationships between entities.
5) Real - Time Fraud Monitoring
  - Stream transaction data using apache kafka / Spark Streaming.
